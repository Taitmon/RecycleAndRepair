# Recycle and Repair
This application was designed to solve two issues that I constanlty ran into at my previos job as a Manager of a Electronics Repair Store. One the devices that were checked in need a way to be tracked, Two if the internet went down then there was no way to check customer in or out with out checking the system to verify customers devices. These two problems were solved by requiring an IMEI from every device that is checked in and this application can be used offline. 

## Running

Run this using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  

```
sbt run
```

And then go to http://localhost:9000/home to see the running web application.
